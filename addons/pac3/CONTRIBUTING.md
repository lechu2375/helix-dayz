# Creating an issue

- ### The issue tracker is for bugs or feature requests. Try to avoid posting issues like "How do I do X?"

- ### Make sure to check if the issue still persists after disabling all addons except pac3.

	You can do this by clicking the wrench icon in the bottom right of the addons menu:

	then pressing the `Disable All` button:

	after that, either re-enable the pac3 addon from the workshop or get the latest version here on GitHub.
